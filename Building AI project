Wildfire Sentinel
Final project for the Building AI course

Summary
Wildfire Sentinel is an AI-powered prediction tool designed to estimate the risk of wildfire outbreaks in specific regions. By analyzing historical weather patterns, soil moisture levels, and satellite vegetation data, the system provides a high-level "Risk Score" to help local authorities prioritize surveillance.
To give you a fresh perspective, here is a complete sample project for the Building AI course using the official template.

This example focuses on a Wildfire Prediction System, a common and impactful use case for AI. You can use this as a reference for how to fill out each section.

Summary
Wildfire Sentinel is an AI-powered prediction tool designed to estimate the risk of wildfire outbreaks in specific regions. By analyzing historical weather patterns, soil moisture levels, and satellite vegetation data, the system provides a high-level "Risk Score" to help local authorities prioritize surveillance.

Background
Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, causing massive ecological and economic damage.

Problem 1: Firefighting resources are often spread too thin because they react to fires rather than predicting them.

Problem 2: Remote areas are difficult to monitor manually 24/7.

Motivation: My motivation is to use machine learning to protect biodiversity and human settlements in high-risk zones.

How is it used?
The solution is intended for use by environmental agencies and emergency services. It operates as a dashboard that refreshes every 24 hours with new meteorological data.

Environment: Rural and forested regions.

Users: Fire marshals and emergency planners who need to decide where to station water bombers or ground crews before a fire starts.
# A simple mock-up of a risk calculation based on temperature and wind
def calculate_risk(temp, humidity, wind_speed):
    # Simplified logic: higher temp and wind + lower humidity = higher risk
    risk_score = (temp * 0.5) + (wind_speed * 0.3) - (humidity * 0.2)
    
    if risk_score > 25:
        return "HIGH RISK"
    return "LOW/MODERATE RISK"

# Example: 35°C, 10% humidity, 20km/h wind
print(f"Current conditions: {calculate_risk(35, 10, 20)}")
